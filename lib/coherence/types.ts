/**
 * Types for the "Promesses vs Formule" feature.
 *
 * Pipeline (anti-hallucination by construction):
 *   1. LLM extracts marketing promises from the description (constrained JSON).
 *   2. LLM proposes documented active ingredients for each promise (constrained
 *      to known categories from `claims.ts`).
 *   3. Engine matches proposed actives against the parent INCI analysis items
 *      by slug/name - purely mechanical, the LLM never decides.
 *   4. Engine reads each match's `thresholdContext` to decide if it's well
 *      dosed (above the 1% line) or in trace (after fragrance/preservative).
 *   5. Engine derives the verdict per promise from the match results.
 *   6. LLM writes a one-sentence conclusion based on the engine's verdicts.
 *
 * Steps 3-5 are deterministic. The LLM only proposes candidates and rephrases
 * - it cannot invent ingredients that aren't in the formula.
